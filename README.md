# The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. The designs are in JPG static format.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
